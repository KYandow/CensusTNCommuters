# CensusTNCommuters

This projects follows the details in the Analyzing US Census Data and Working with Geospatial Data in Python from Datacamp. I'm using 2018 ACS 5-year data to start, and may expand to earlier years as needed.

Ultimate goal is to tie the FCC's broadband data for Tennessee (or the region) to some relevant demographic indicators such as Work From Home status or Education levels, as well as Tennessee's own broadband expansion efforts.
